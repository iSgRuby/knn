This simple guide is assuming you have ruby installed in your pc and you already make all the steps to configure ruby

1) clone this repository

3) in the root execute the following command 'ruby lib/main.rb'
   when doing this the program is going to be running
   
4) Insert the option 5 to generate two groups
     Now you can look at the 'scatter_chart.png' generated in the root of the project
     Also you can look at the ouput files in the folder './output/'
   
5) Insert the option 4 to add some points, add the info and after that take a look into the './output/knncheck.txt'
  it will show the k, also watch the the chart, there are going to be all the new points generated

7) Insert anything to continue with the execution and check the knncheck.txt

You can add more groups with the option 1 and after added the group you will have to add points to this new group with the option 2
Once added the points you can insert the option 3 to load the chart and watch your new group in the chart
